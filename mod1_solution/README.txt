This version should also work with the bonus requirement.

## BONUS (OPTIONAL AND NOT GRADED)
The first 2 of these can be done in a more advanced way, but can also be done with just what we've learned so far!
* If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the font color green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the font color red.
* If the message is "Enjoy!" or "Too much!", make the border color around the textbox green. If the message is "Please enter data first", make the border color around the textbox red.
* Implement this case `item 1, item2,,item3` or this case `item 1, item2, ,item3` as not counting an 'empty' item towards the count of how many items there are in the list. Please *make sure* to put a comment somewhere next to the input textbox stating that you do NOT consider and empty item, i.e., `, ,` as an item towards to the count, so whoever is grading your assignment doesn't erroneously mark that as an error.
